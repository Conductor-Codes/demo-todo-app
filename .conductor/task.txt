User Story: As a user, I want to be able to delete a todo item from my list so that I can manage my tasks more effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user interface must display a list of todo items that have been added.
2. Each todo item in the list should have a 'Delete' button next to it.
3. Clicking the 'Delete' button next to a todo item should immediately remove the item from the list.
4. The deletion of a todo item should be reflected in the application's state, ensuring that the item does not reappear upon subsequent renders.
5. A test case should be added to verify that a todo item can be successfully deleted. This test should simulate the user clicking the 'Delete' button for a specific todo item and then verify that the item is no longer present in the DOM.

Technical Implementation Details:
- Modify the 'App' component to include a 'handleDeleteTodo' function that takes an index as a parameter and updates the 'todos' state by filtering out the todo item at the specified index.
- Update the rendering of todo items in the 'App' component to include a 'Delete' button next to each item. This button should have an onClick event handler that calls 'handleDeleteTodo' with the index of the todo item to be deleted.
- Ensure that the 'Delete' button is styled consistently with the existing application design, using Tailwind CSS classes as necessary.
- Update the existing test suite to include a test case for the deletion functionality. This test should use '@testing-library/react' and '@testing-library/user-event' to simulate the deletion of a todo item and verify its removal from the list.
